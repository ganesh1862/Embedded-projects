ESP32 Weather Station
A firmware project for the ESP32 microcontroller that connects to Wi-Fi, fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and displays a formatted report over the serial console. Built using the ESP-IDF framework.

Features
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Connects to a designated Wi-Fi access point using WPA2.

RESTful API Integration: Makes HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

JSON Parsing: Efficiently parses complex JSON responses using the cJSON library.

Comprehensive Weather Data: Displays a wide range of meteorological information:

City name and country

Local timestamp with timezone adjustment

Current temperature and "feels like" temperature (째C)

Humidity (%) and atmospheric pressure (hPa)

Weather conditions (e.g., "Clouds" with a description like "overcast clouds")

Wind speed (m/s) and compass direction

Visibility (km)

Automated & Periodic: Fetches new data automatically every 60 seconds after an initial 30-second delay.

Robust Error Handling: Includes retry logic for Wi-Fi connection and detailed error logging for HTTP and JSON parsing.

=Hardware Requirements
An ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32, ESP32-DevKitC).
A USB cable for power, flashing, and serial communication.
